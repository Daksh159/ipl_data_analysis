# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis using Apache Spark

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on large-scale **data analysis of Indian Premier League (IPL) match data** using **Apache Spark**. The goal is to demonstrate how distributed data processing can be used to extract meaningful insights from real-world sports data such as team performance, player statistics, match outcomes, and season-wise trends.

The project emphasizes **scalability, efficiency, and analytics-ready outputs**, making it suitable for data analytics and big data engineering roles.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform large-scale data processing using **Apache Spark**
* Analyze IPL match and ball-by-ball data efficiently
* Generate insights related to teams, players, venues, and seasons
* Apply Spark SQL for structured analytical queries
* Build analytics outputs suitable for dashboards and reports

---

## 🗂 Dataset

The analysis is performed on IPL datasets containing:

* Match-level information (season, teams, venue, winner, result)
* Ball-by-ball data (runs, wickets, players involved)

The dataset is structured and processed using Spark DataFrames and Spark SQL for optimized querying.
